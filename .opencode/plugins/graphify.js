// graphify OpenCode plugin
// Injects a knowledge graph reminder before the first shell command of a
// session when the graph exists.
//
// One file for both runtimes. OpenCode 2 reads `id` and `setup()` from the
// default export; OpenCode 1 (1.3.4 and later) reads `server()` from it. Each
// ignores the other's function. Nothing is imported from an opencode package:
// a plain file in .opencode/plugins/ cannot resolve one.
//
// IMPORTANT: keep the reminder string free of backticks and $(...) constructs.
// The hook prepends `echo "<reminder>" ; <cmd>` to the user's shell command;
// backticks inside the double-quoted echo trigger command substitution,
// which both corrupts tool output and silently executes the very graphify
// command we are only suggesting. Plain words render fine in opencode's TUI.
